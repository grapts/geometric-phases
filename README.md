We present a series of Technical Reports in relation to the article K. Snizhko, N. Rao, P. Kumar, and Y. Gefen, Weak-
measurement-induced phases and dephasing: Broken symmetry of the geometric phase, Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 043045 (2021), arXiv:2006.14641. 

In this collection of reports we a analyze a series of technical issues, concerning the limits of validity of the analytic result reported in Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 042045 (2021). 
The issues under consideration can be outlined as follows:

1. Taking the limit of strong measurement (C → ∞)
or quasiadiabatic evolution (A → ∞) is claimed to
be invalid.

3. The issue of non-Hermitian Kraus operators and
their relation to the topological transitions in the
measurement-induced phase is claimed to be un-
clear and contradictive to Ref. [2].

4. The separation of measurement-induced phases
into dynamical and geometrical is criticized.

5. The possibility of an experimental apparatus imple-
menting the measurements of the considered class
is doubted.

The Technical Reports present contrasting numerical evidence as documented in two main files:
