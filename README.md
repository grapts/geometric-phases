We present a series of Technical Reports in relation to the article K. Snizhko, N. Rao, P. Kumar, and Y. Gefen, Weak-
measurement-induced phases and dephasing: Broken symmetry of the geometric phase, Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 043045 (2021), arXiv:2006.14641 [1]. 

In this collection of reports we a analyze a series of technical issues, concerning the limits of validity of the analytic result reported in Ref. [1]. The issues under consideration can be outlined as follows:

1. The exponential approximation $(1+\Gamma/N)^N \approx \exp{\Gamma}$ invoked in the analytic result reported in Ref. [1] is claimed to be questionable, in the limit of strong measurement (C → ∞)

2. The issue of non-Hermitian Kraus operators, and their relation to the topological transitions in the
measurement-induced phase, is claimed to be unclear and contradictive to Gerhart et al., PNAS March 17, 2020 117 (11) 5706-5713.

3. The separation of measurement-induced phases into dynamical and geometrical is claimed to be "\emph{unsurprising}".

4. The possibility of an experimental apparatus implementing the non-Hermitian measurements of the considered class is not convincingly presented in Ref. [1]

The Technical Reports present contrasting numerical evidence as documented in two main files:
